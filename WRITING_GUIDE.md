# Writing Guidelines

## Post Format (Individual Stories)

Create files in `_posts/` with naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Story Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0100
categories: [life, memories, health, etc]
---

Your story content here in Markdown...
```

## Book Format (Long-form Narratives)

Create files in `_books/` for chapters:

```markdown
---
layout: book
title: "Chapter Title"
book: "Book Name"
chapter: 1
---

Chapter content here...
```

## Tips for Writing

- Write in whatever style feels natural
- Don't worry about perfect grammar - I can help edit later
- Add details that make the memory vivid
- Include emotions and sensory details
- Date and time context helps place memories

## Mobile Writing

On GitHub mobile app or browser:
1. Navigate to `_posts/` or `_books/`
2. Tap "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Name it properly (date-title.md)
4. Write in Markdown
5. Commit when ready

Drafts can stay local until you're ready to commit!
