This is my new writing home. A place for stories, memories, and reflections.

I'm starting this project because I want to preserve my stories while I'm feeling good and motivated. Life is unpredictable, and I want to capture these moments while they're fresh.

This space is for:
- **Individual memories** - stories from my life, big and small
- **Long-form narratives** - continuous stories organized by chapters
- **Reflections** - thoughts about life, health, creativity

I can write here anytime - from my laptop with Jacob's help, or directly from my phone when inspiration strikes.

Let's see where this journey takes us.
